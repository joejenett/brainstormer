I doubt I would have survived those days at home had it not been for my wife Kim who was always there for me. We stayed in touch with messages and everything I needed appeared in a flash. She is kinda amazing, thank you.</p>\n\n<p>So. One late evening, I used Siri to tell Kim “help” (not an odd request in context). A short while thereafter, the doorbell rang several times. It was the police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-could-this-happen\">how could this happen?</h2>\n<p>When I gave the <em>hey Siri</em>, it was picked up by a new HomePod, recently purchased to use as a hub for Matter accessories. At the time, I replaced 4 outlets with new ones requiring the new hub. I failed to take into account the fact that the HomePod provides only spoken confirmations. Turns out I heard the confirmation just as poorly as Siri heard my command. Oops! My bad!</p>\n\n<p>So a neighbor of ours named Ken got the help message and rightfully called the police because he was concerned that it could be a genuine request (though he thought it was most likely some kind of error). I later told him how much I appreciated that he cared enough to do that. Good neighbor.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"and-what-did-joe-learn\">and what did joe learn?</h2>\n<p>If Siri turns off the wrong light, so what! When Siri sends an important message to the wrong person though, that’s a biggie. Though Kim convinced the police that everything was okay, it could have gone much differently.</p>\n\n<p>It didn’t take long to figure out how it happened and what I needed to do to prevent such a thing in the future.</p>\n\n<p>New rule - disable <em>personal requests</em> on devices that provide spoken confirmations only. Done.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon\"></a></p>\n",
