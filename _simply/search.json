I doubt I would have survived those days at home had it not been for my wife Kim who was always there for me. We stayed in touch with messages and everything I needed appeared in a flash. She is kinda amazing, thank you.\n\nSo. One late evening, I used Siri to tell Kim ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (not an odd request in context). A short while thereafter, the doorbell rang several times. It was the police.\n\nhow could this happen?\nWhen I gave the hey Siri, it was picked up by a new HomePod, recently purchased to use as a hub for Matter accessories. At the time, I replaced 4 outlets with new ones requiring the new hub. I failed to take into account the fact that the HomePod provides only spoken confirmations. Turns out I heard the confirmation just as poorly as Siri heard my command. Oops! My bad!\n\nSo a neighbor of ours named Ken got the help message and rightfully called the police because he was concerned that it could be a genuine request (though he thought it was most likely some kind of error). I later told him how much I appreciated that he cared enough to do that. Good neighbor.\n\nand what did joe learn?\nIf Siri turns off the wrong light, so what! When Siri sends an important message to the wrong person though, that‚Äôs a biggie. Though Kim convinced the police that everything was okay, it could have gone much differently.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt take long to figure out how it happened and what I needed to do to prevent such a thing in the future.\n\nNew rule - disable personal requests on devices that provide spoken confirmations only. Done.\n\n\n",

After doing the daily thing on the web for over 20 years, it was time for a change. \n\n\nAs I said over at the hub back then, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a little too old to keep up with the ‚Äòdaily‚Äô part of its name.‚Äù I wanted to continue doing what I truly love to do on the web without that daily pressure to make the donuts. I like to think my donuts are tasty enough to enjoy even if they weren't available every day.\n\n\nSo I created the dailywebthing archives and have been posting new links at the i.webthings hub every 2-3 days. The old feeds from the linkport and pointers  redirect to the i.webthings feed.\n\n\nThe upside of this major change is I‚Äôm a happier camper now. I‚Äôm sharing almost as many links per week as I was before while having more time for other ongoing creative projects. Most important, I now enjoy a better balance between the webthings and non-web things in my life. \n\n\nBut...\n\nI‚Äôve made a number of changes to my web presence over the years, many very recently, and the last thing I want to do is to be a royal pain to those who most enjoy what I‚Äôm doing out here, those who have so generously paid attention to my efforts.  \n\n\nRSS is a big part of what I do and I understand firsthand what it means put up with things like feed changes. Yes, it can be a pain. That‚Äôs one of the downsides of change. Hopefully, the upside makes the change worth it. \n\nFinally, I must respond to something Poorchop said recently:\nI would wager that most of the very few people who know about this website only found out about it after receiving a mention from me. \nI know the feeling buddy and I‚Äôm glad to know ya!\n\n\n",

The song is about pain felt over the way he‚Äôs treated by a woman though I‚Äôve always felt a connection to the lyrics as they might relate to other kinds of pain in my own experience. They convey a certain intensity of pain, primally and clearly. Though written in the 1970s, they continue to inspire me just as my discovering Stevie Ray Vaughan in the 1990s does. Add a little Muddy Waters and B.B. King and shake well - I love the blues. You can feel the pain and when you‚Äôre lucky, you can feel the joy.\nnewfound inspiration\nWhen I‚Äôm sitting around with just my guitar improvising, I find it easy to let out whatever pain or joy I‚Äôm feeling through the lyrics. Maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not recording when I‚Äôm alone. It doesn‚Äôt get shared. I  wrote about my wonderful problem before. I need to get better at telling it like it is and sharing it.\nA recent journal entry by Winnie Lim has rekindled my desire to get better at telling it like it is whether I‚Äôm writing blog posts or improvising music and lyrics. I‚Äôm so in awe of her ability to express herself freely. I can indeed feel the pain - both her pain and my own.\nI‚Äôve never mentioned it before. I live with chronic physical pain.

      "content"  : "\nThe phrase \"jumping the shark\" is used to argue that a creative outlet or work appears to be making a misguided attempt at generating new attention or publicity for something that is perceived to be once, but no longer, widely popular.// Jumping the shark\nI guess I should thank The Fonz for having inspired the coining of that phrase.  Back in what I like to call the day, exploring the web and sharing links was widely popular.\nAs a kind of self-appointed tour guide to the web, my early efforts brought more attention to me than I ever wanted (or could handle). To be honest, it was arduous at times dealing with some of the trolls and opportunists that popularity brings.\n I‚Äôve never seen the web as a business opportunity. A hunger for engaging with others, not popularity (or profit), is what‚Äôs driven my desire to be a curator (of sorts). Knowing that others enjoyed something I shared has always been the gratification I was after. Fame and fortune are highly overrated.\nand then the web changed\nWith the dawn of Web 2.0 came a larger web centralized in a few huge silos and the demise of personal websites in general. It became harder to find the type of websites I wanted to share. Let me be honest again. The growing popularity of social media and scarcity of personal websites since the inception of Web 2.0 made my ‚Äòjob‚Äô harder but it also made the curation thing more meaningful to me.\nSo I‚Äôve kept plugging away through the years - as the popularity of exploring the web diminished, jumping the shark brought me a new sense of personal fulfillment. I‚Äôm odd like that\na new web is evolving\nNo. I‚Äôm not talking about Web3. I‚Äôm talking about that original smaller web gradually coming back as we speak. Thanks to the efforts of the IndieWeb movement, unique personal site hosting opportunities like Neocities and numerous other ways to easily create a website, (along with a growing dissatisfaction with social media), things are finally changing again... for the better.\nTo name just a few, thanks to people like Kicks Condor (href.cool) and Sadgrl (Yesterlinks) and sites like The Yesterweb and Gossip‚Äôs Web, a growing number of people are once again creating their own websites, exploring the web, and sharing links. The resurgence of webrings has been helpful too.\nPut your skis on and join the fun. Jumping the shark ain‚Äôt so bad!\n\n\n",

The first stage of my simplification project started about 6 months ago - it‚Äôs almost done.\n\nRay was talking about his sensible simplification of Blogroll.org. The change not only helped bring back the fun for him - it also improved the user experience. I like it!\n\nHis story reminds me of my own need to simplify. Too many domains, too many Wordpress installations, and too many things to keep updated. Like Ray, I thought this was supposed to be fun. I‚Äôve been doing this web thing for 24 years now and due to simplifying, I‚Äôm pleased to say it‚Äôs even more fun now. \n\nI‚Äôll spare you the details of the project. But if you explore my web a bit, you‚Äôll probably get it. Like Ray said:\n\nAhhhh‚Ä¶ I can breathe easier and I don‚Äôt feel pressure anymore to keep so many things updated.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs why this blog is now simply.\n\n\nPrevious Comments:\n Scoot Ray commented on Nov 13, 2021\n\nThanks for the kind mention, Joe! I love the name you've given your blog - simply. Perfect.\n\nYour post reminded me I need to apply \"simply\" to my personal blog too when I find the time; it's gotten a bit bloated there too.\n\nTake care.\nRay\n\n joejenett commented on Nov 13, 2021\n\nThank you for inspiring me to write about about my project Ray. This blog is just one of a number of sites which were either migrated from Wordpress to static sites, and/or moved into subdomains of jenett.org for the sake of more permanent archives (without owning so many domains). It was worth every minute of the work.\n\nAs a result, I‚Äôm more focused on regularly updating the dailywebthing linkport and daily pointers and not worrying so much about the other active sites ('cause there's less of 'em). Simplifying is a good route to better enjoying what I do (and getting more done). Yay!\n\nYou take care too...\n\nJoe\n\n\n",

Our leaders‚Äô priorities are not at all in line with the needs of our nation.\n\nI could say more but since it‚Äôs all been said before, I doubt you want to hear it. I know I don‚Äôt want to say it. There‚Äôs more to life than the misery we‚Äôre witnessing - there has to be!\n\nwe need balance\n\nPart of survival is the realization that focusing only on dire straits (such as the current crisis represents) can be a sure path to going insane. We need balance. Life goes on despite it all and experience tells me distraction is a key to survival. It works for me anyway. It always has. Whether it‚Äôs writing about or only thinking about something other than the immediate global crisis, it‚Äôs important to find balance - therapeutic indeed.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the point if we can‚Äôt use our limited time here on earth doing what we find meaningful and accomplishing those things we‚Äôve set out to do before our time is up! We‚Äôre all vulnerable and that‚Äôs the perfect reason to do what we do while we still can in my opinion.\n\nStay safe and stay sane.\n\nOne thought on ‚Äúwhat to say‚Äù\t\t\n\n\n\n\nLikes\n\nBrad Enslen\n\n",

My stay in the ICU went on for 12 days and finally I came home. I remembered my name and there were no nasty physical symptoms - nothing to prevent me from surviving this thing intact.\n\nThat was nine years go and fortunately, what was done following the hemorrhage was effective. At last inspection, I was given a lifetime guarantee by the physician. We both chuckled at that.\n\nmodern medicine\n\nThe timing of all this was lucky - that guy who came in late at night and took care of my problem without even cutting me open had been practicing about 15 (maybe 20) years, having been one of the earlier practitioners of that type of interventional radiology. He told me stories about Neil Young and Sharon Stone having survived similar procedures and going on to live normal lives. I felt rather normal for someone who also survived it.\n\nand the bottom line\n\nDid somebody say normal? There is no normal. What‚Äôs normal exists within each of our souls and experience. And if there‚Äôs a point to be made about normal and surviving terrible things, it‚Äôs that life goes on.

I like to think I spend the time sifting through noise (whether it comes from search results, RSS feeds, Pinboard, or any other source) so you don‚Äôt have to (unless of course, your tastes and preferences are different than mine). If you‚Äôre looking for any or all those other types of sites I mentioned in why i link, search engines are fine and you are your own curator. I do what I do for the relatively small number of people out there who share my tastes and preferences. I never encountered a search engine that let you search for personal blogs free of annoyances like popups, promotional page overlays, and overtly commercial content (or tone). It takes human curation to sift those things out. It‚Äôs very subjective, I know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tjoejenett says:\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2, 2019 at 12:57 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n@canion btw ‚Äì I‚Äôm glad you enjoy the links.

With only one sidebar there is a lot more focus on the discovery aspects of the page.\nI‚Äôm glad you showed this to me, I‚Äôve been considering trying to start a linkport of my own ‚Äì only in a niche ‚Äì and I was thinking of trying to do it with B2evolution.net blog and they mostly just have one sidebar themes.  This gives me something of an idea what that would look like.  I really do like your linkport idea.\nThanks for the preview!  I like the way it looks.

Besides the indieweb stuff, just being able to paginate the category pages will be great- the existing site has huge pages for some categories and I had to abbreviate those listings to keep the page sizes down ‚Äì it‚Äôs better for the user if they can see the full posts when browsing a category. (After the change we‚Äôll have to adjust that search link you added to your directory ‚Äì it will still work in the meantime.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tbradenslen says:\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 18, 2019 at 8:03 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n@jenett That makes sense on the categories.

This is great!\n It‚Äôs funny‚ÄîI stumbled across the VISUAL OBSERVER link around the same time as you. I think we‚Äôre both plundering a lot of the same tags and users on Pinboard. This has made me want to pool our link-finding knowledge, in the hopes of discovering where we‚Äôre being redundant and where we might want to venture out further. (I need to make a list of my main discovery avenues.)\n To what degree do you grind away, looking for links? Or do you wait for them to come to you?\n\n\n\n\n\nKicks Condor\t\t\t\t\t\t\n-\n\nJanuary 23, 2019 at 12:04 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tjoe jenett says:\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2019 at 1:47 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the compliments Kicks. The dailywebthing linkport and daily pointers contain over 8,500 posts between them so it was a lot of work. Like you, I‚Äôm excited about what the indieweb brings to my sites. That leads me to the question you asked. Since 1997, I‚Äôve spent, on average, about 4 hours per day grinding away on my web linking projects, which also included coolstop.com (daily site reviews) from 10/1997 thru 9/2010. I can‚Äôt conceive of the notion of waiting for links to come to me, which leads me to the other part of your comment.\nYou‚Äôve mentioned a desire to collaborate before, so I have to be honest. My linking thing is very personal to me. Though I can appreciate your desire for learning more, I truly don‚Äôt have hopes of ‚Äúdiscovering where we‚Äôre being redundant and where we might want to venture out further‚Äù beyond what I‚Äôm already doing through observation and interaction. What I mean to say is that I‚Äôm not looking to combine my efforts with yours (or vice-versa). We‚Äôve already shared knowledge and our enthusiasm for the medium and our love for linking ‚Äì that‚Äôs sure to be an ongoing (enjoyable) thing. But pooling our knowledge, or collaborating between sites on some type of joint effort is different than simply communicating between sites, and between us, in my mind. I know it might sound unfriendly but I don‚Äôt necessarily want to share everything. Yes, web surfing is a skill and you already know how to do it pretty damn well. We both link to unique things and I‚Äôm really comfortable with the thought of each of our sites having its own unique identity.\nAs I become better at expressing the motivation behind what I do and how deeply committed I am to certain aspects of it, things may get clearer. In the meantime, our recent conversations have played an important part in the direction my sites are going. I appreciate that and hope my brutal honesty doesn‚Äôt offend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKicks Condor ‚Äì Should We Pool?: \n\n Since 1997, Ive spent, on average, about 4 hours per day grinding away on my web linking projects, which also included coolstop.com (daily site reviews) from 10/1997 thru 9/2010. I cant conceive of the notion of waiting for links to come to me, which leads me to the other part of your comment. \n\n Ok, interesting‚Äîyeah, I‚Äôd agree, hunting can suck up hours of time. And, yeah, if you are spending four hours per day, I‚Äôm not going to keep up, since I‚Äôm lucky to get in four hours per week. Glad for your honest reason. Very glad for ‚Äòbrutal‚Äô honesty‚Äîto just have your thoughts succinctly, rather than to beat around the bush for three months. \n\n What I mean to say is that I‚Äôm not looking to combine my efforts with yours (or vice-versa). We‚Äôve already shared knowledge and our enthusiasm for the medium and our love for linking‚Äîthat‚Äôs sure to be an ongoing (enjoyable) thing. But pooling our knowledge, or collaborating between sites on some type of joint effort is different than simply communicating between sites, and between us, in my mind. \n\n Right‚ÄîI don‚Äôt mean to say that we‚Äôre going to just merge our sites together‚Äîalthough I did discuss trying to be clear about link-finding strategies, which borders on a trade secret I suppose. (Especially where you‚Äôve been doing this for several decades.) And I am happy to rescind that request‚ÄîI‚Äôm not trying to steal your strategy, even if I am planning to clearly lay out mine. \n But let‚Äôs back up: I think we must have a fundamentally different view of where the Web is today. (imho) Link-finding has changed dramatically from the early days of the Web. Back then, everything was a link. The whole landscape was personal home pages, web comics, and niche forums. Magellan-level exploration.\n Today, the Web we‚Äôre inhabiting is a niche. There is very little growth out here by comparison. Surely, there is still an infinite landscape to explore, but much of it is ad-ridden, startup- or software-focused. ‚ÄòBloggers‚Äô are moving toward ‚Äòinfluencers‚Äô. When people talk about ‚Äòthe blogs‚Äô, they think about pundits, TMZ-type Paparazzi and minor celebrities. The rest of blogging has become an extension of Pinterest: personal recipe and home decor blogs dominate.\n The ‚ÄòIndieweb‚Äô/‚ÄòIndie Web‚Äô is a niche like vinyl collectors. It won‚Äôt ever achieve mainstream significance again. When I talk to meatspace friends about The Web, they look at it as a quaint little city that doesn‚Äôt really offer them anything new. And the only thing I can appeal to is a type of idealism: aesthetic and political idealism.\n So, whereas link-finding use to be the essential task of mapping out the frontier, our new task is different: to broadcast the location of our outpost so that the holdouts who are still blogging and the wanderers, who happen to be drawn to experiment with a blog, know where we are. \n I really think that an important part of our work will be to lay out how we link-find‚Äînot so that newcomers can just copy the technique‚Äîbut so that they know where we‚Äôre looking. If we‚Äôre looking at tags on Pinboard, then they know where to post on Pinboard. If we‚Äôre sharing on certain hashtags on Twitter, then they know. In the past, this might have caused those channels to be oversatured‚Äîbut I really don‚Äôt think spam will be our problem. Our problem is survival.\n Of course, we wish the old days would return. But the future will be better, somehow. I just don‚Äôt think it will inhabit The Web again.\n If you disagree or roll your eyes at any of this‚Äîno problem, no problem whatsoever. The invitation is soft‚Äîno need to get involved with anything. Focus on your work. (Fantastic work!) I just hope that my efforts won‚Äôt be upsetting you in some way. I‚Äôd rather be of a benefit, if that can possibly be the case. \n\n\n\n\n\nKicks Condor\t\t\t\t\t\t\n-\n\nJanuary 25, 2019 at 1:59 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tjoe jenett says:\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 25, 2019 at 6:10 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nKicks ‚Äì Thanks for understanding what I was trying to say. Based on what you clarified in your reply, let me offer the following: I do find many links via pinboard and follow a large and growing list of users (via my network rss feed, which includes all of the users I‚Äôve subscribed to). I cite the pinboard user as the source when a link I use comes from them (which is relatively easy to track). I find new pinboard users to follow both by browsing pinboard and by following and filtering the recent rss feed. I also follow a few tags like design, dev, blogs, automation, etc. The most important feed is the network feed.\nI also have a number of other sources I follow by feed and by browsing/exploring/surfing the web (which I won‚Äôt share as a list though I‚Äôve linked to many of them). In general, I try to cite sources when I find new links, though tracking all of that information has its limitations. Anyone who explores my sites can see my sources. If they don‚Äôt see a source cited it might be that I couldn‚Äôt track it, it‚Äôs a link I‚Äôve seen on more than one site, or it‚Äôs the type of site I simply will not link to (for a number of reasons like ads, annoyances, or commercial content/tone, as examples). In many cases, I‚Äôve linked to sites at the dailywebthing who are also sources/potential sources for other links. Several of your projects and Brad‚Äôs directory are just a few examples. Finally on this subject, I‚Äôve got to say that the micro.blog community leads to a lot of web out there, particularly newer blogs.\nAs far as how we view the web, I may be a little simple-minded about linking. My goal is to provide people with a pleasant web surfing experience, free of the ad-ridden crap and all the other types of annoyances that the web is full of (and always has been). To me, it‚Äôs very subjective what I mean when I use like words like ‚Äòpleasant‚Äô or ‚Äòannoying‚Äô or even ‚Äòuseful.‚Äô In my case, what I do when I ‚Äòlink-find‚Äô is probably somewhat a reaction to some things I don‚Äôt care for. The new indieweb tools do help get the word out and also lead to interaction ‚Äì those are good things that enhance linking. But yes, it ‚Äòs all kinda like vinyl records or even the Grateful Dead. I don‚Äôt mind being part of the few. Mainstream is over-rated and scarcity adds value to the gems we find.\nI didn‚Äôt think you wanted to ‚Äòmerge‚Äô sites or anything like that. But it seemed to me you wanted to somehow coordinate our efforts, and whether I took that right or wrong, that‚Äôs what I was responding to. I like your honesty too ‚Äì it makes for meaningful discourse. Thanks.\n",

Just being able to inform others that their blog or article has been included to is a very powerful thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tjenett says:\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nDecember 23, 2018 at 9:37 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n@bradenslen Thanks ‚Äì It‚Äôs an evolving idea.\nAnd being informed by others is a good thing too.

I‚Äôd be interested to hear more of your reaction. At first, I thought it\nwas kind of a novelty‚Äîlike a quirky little website, no big deal.\nBut I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs a big deal! He solves a lot of his technical\nissues by simply coming up with human conventions to solve them. Rather than waiting for his wiki to become compatible with Reddit, he just copies and pastes his conversations from there. Rather than trying to setup a group or a forum tocommunicate between his readers‚Äîhe just copies and pastes their e-mails, voila‚Äîthey are suddenly reading each other!\nMost importantly, he doesn‚Äôt rely on an algorithm to sift through his communication. He just reads‚Äîin true human form‚Äîand writes back in detail. And readers are expected to do the same. There are no ‚Äòpopular‚Äô posts that people are reading or ‚Äòhot‚Äô posts that are stimulating conversation‚Äîyou just have to dig around.\nI also think he‚Äôs successfully merged microblogging, linkposting, ephemeral notetaking with the creation of a larger body of work‚Äîwhich all stems from his central lexicon that he‚Äôs working to define. It‚Äôs very inspiring to read h0p3 and then to think, ‚ÄúHmm, if I put this kind of work into my own thoughts‚Äîhow would it look?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nKicks Condor\t\t\t\t\t\t\n-\n\nDecember 18, 2018 at 3:32 pm\n",

We weren‚Äôt concerned with becoming ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù or selling our personal expressions; we only wanted to share them, enjoy them, interact, and live. It was in our blood and it was magic and like anything special, we hoped it would never end. For some of us, it never did end though finding like minds has become next to impossible now and we‚Äôre left feeling the magic mostly alone. Things have changed. Things always change. Keeping the magic alive is a lonely, frustrating endeavor sometimes. But the magic remains in my heart and makes me whole. In the end, I‚Äôm thankful to say I have what I need.\n\nOne wouldn‚Äôt think a company holiday party could provide a means to experience that magic again. As I centered in on the big guy playing the guitar, I thought to myself that he could probably help me pull it off. I felt oddly connected to him but surely didn‚Äôt want to horn in on his gig. He and his proteges were entertaining a diverse crowd that night and they seemed to like his stuff. When he was in between songs though, I was near the stage and told him I really liked what they were doing. I also told him how much I would love doing Stormy Monday with him. To my surprise, he said, ‚ÄúCome on dude!‚Äù He told me he didn‚Äôt know the song and I assured him it would be easy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a simple 1,4,5 in A. Slow and easy, just follow me.‚Äù\n\nAnd so he and his group and I proceeded to do the tune and it really hit the spot. Seeing that big room get quiet as we did it was just what I needed that night. The big guy said ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù And so did I as we briefly hugged and I gave him his stage back. Here‚Äôs to connecting and keeping the magic alive!\n",

I was in Intensive Care for about 12 days. Kim was at my side virtually the whole time and my niece Nicole was there a good part of the time as well. With their love and support, I managed to survive what seemed to be the very worst that could happen. I‚Äôm a lucky man.\n\nDuring that time in the ICU, Kim told me several times how Mojo seemed despondent about my absence. He moped around the house as if something had been taken from him. That made me sad and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get home to my main man. After returning home, the little guy stayed at my side around-the-clock while I was recuperating. His constant presence made a difference and I felt a new appreciation for just how loyal a friend he is.\n\n\n\nNow, unfortunately, the tables have turned. Mojo has fluid in his lungs, possibly the result of heart disease, which I understand is a common ailment for cats which are all or part Maine Coon. He‚Äôs on several medications and I‚Äôm trying to comfort him in any way I can and to make sure he keeps eating. He‚Äôs been on the medications for less than a week and we were warned that we probably wouldn‚Äôt see a change until after 1 to 2 weeks. Trying to keep my sunny side up but have to admit it‚Äôs not easy ‚Äì I love Mojo.\n\nPlease wish my little guy luck. I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs going to need it...\n\nUpdate (8/15): Some definite improvement, ‚Äì hopefully, that will continue‚Ä¶;~))\n\n(prior discussion)\n",

I think she knew that. I‚Äôm sure she knew that.\n\nI wondered what the instrument was and went looking for the answer. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it‚Äôs a three-stringed version of an Ehru, called the Sanhu.\n\nFinally, that photo in my inbox reminded me to keep playing and writing.

      "content"  : "Earlier this week, when I was on the way back home from dropping Kim off at work, I reached a certain intersection downtown and stopped for the red light. It was about 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning and I was heading northbound.\n\n\n\nAt the cross street, a pedestrian waited on one corner for the light to change. She was carrying a small white plastic bag with something round in it, like a ball, and repeatedly pressed the button trying to make the light change in her favor. It did change eventually and she crossed the street, southbound, towards the little strip mall on the other side as I drove through the intersection towards home.\n\nAbout 3 hours later, I left the house to run a few errands and ended up crossing that same intersection, this time heading southbound. A I drove through it, I noticed that same lady carrying the same bag crossing the same street in the same direction as before. ‚ÄúAn odd coincidence,‚Äù I think to myself. ‚ÄúWhat are the odds of that happening?‚Äù I go on my way and my thoughts return to getting a few things done.\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, I was heading back home and drove by that intersection one more time. To my surprise, there she was, crossing the intersection yet again in the opposite direction as she was when I encountered her earlier, carrying that same plastic bag.\n\nShe must have finished her errands too and was also heading back home. Or was she? There might be a story behind all of this that goes much deeper. Perhaps she was stuck at that intersection, crossing back and forth the whole time from when I first saw her until I last saw her. Or maybe she was lost. I guess I‚Äôll never know, but I‚Äôve found myself looking for her each time I‚Äôve passed that corner since then. In my mind, the experience that day has become some sort of metaphor for the many crossings we have to face in our lives. Getting stuck or lost sometimes are part of the game and somehow, we survive.\n",

He would miss her too, but this journey is a priority now. How could he possibly change what he found happening to him? It‚Äôs hard to lose everything, time after time, and not get a little crazy from it all. No map, no plan, no sense! Running for the sake of running is an empty endeavor. When nothing feels right, and every day is a labor to find a positive attitude about anything, all one can do is run. Why not? Running becomes a form of seeking - but not something you‚Äôve envisioned. It‚Äôs more like seeking to get away from something you‚Äôve been through, not realizing that you‚Äôre running towards something you could never even conceive of - something you will find to be empty and something you will go through and end up running from.\n",

In these pieces, the here and now is captured via the polymorphous pleasures of cajoling, twisting, cutting, ripping, squishing, layering, gluing, and utterly confounding form and color through collage and paint. These actions enacted upon P√©rez‚Äôs seemingly commonplace studio materials lead to that fleeting and inestimable quality of life that makes her aesthetic endeavoring ineluctably steadfast and beautiful: pure joy.\n\n\nWe also had the pleasure of meeting Ruyell Ho, whose art will be exhibited soon at The Bike Room ‚Äì had a most stimulating conversation with him.

      "content"  : "Saturday afternoon, they decided a drive would be nice and headed out to Soaring Eagle. It‚Äôs about a 2-hour trip and the weather was decent (an oddity this time of year). This particular casino has recently been promoting ‚Äúguaranteed best payouts‚Äù or something to that effect and they hadn‚Äôt been there for a long time, so ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give it a shot.‚Äù\n\nThey spent about 3 hours having fun at the casino. ‚ÄúI wonder where I go to claim that ‚Äòbest payout‚Äô they guarantee,‚Äù he said as they left, a little tired and definitely hungry. She chuckled.\n\nThe drive from Mt. Pleasant to Midland is about 20 miles and there‚Äôs no restaurants until you get close to Midland. As they approach the city, they do a little search on Google Maps and several choices in the downtown area grab their attention. They decide to drive by a place called Molly‚Äôs Bistro and it looks interesting from the outside. ‚ÄúYes. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù She nods. ‚ÄúLooks good.‚Äù\n\nThey walk in. There‚Äôs a jazz trio playing in the center of the dining room and the place is packed. ‚ÄúDo you have a reservation?‚Äù He smiles, ‚ÄúNo, we were just driving by and decided to stop.‚Äù The hostess smiles back. ‚ÄúLet me see what I can do.‚Äù She comes back in about a minute. ‚ÄúThis way please.‚Äù They‚Äôre hungry and thankful as the hostess leads them to a table right next to the music. ‚ÄúPerfect!‚Äù And the music sounded sweet.\n\n A lady comes up to the stage as the trio wraps up their song and looks at the bass player. He nods and she nods. The song starts and this lady can really sing. They‚Äôre getting excited now and though the menu looks rather pricey, they‚Äôre hungry and the music is somewhat magical. As long as the food is good, they‚Äôre all set.\n\nThe singer does a few more songs, all great, and leaves the stage as the trio continues doing their thing. She walks to the table next to us and starts removing glasses from it. ‚ÄúShe must work here,‚Äù he thinks to himself. Maybe they make the entertainers do a little work in-between songs. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that odd?‚Äù Kim nods. ‚ÄúMaybe this is her place.‚Äù\n\nAs it turns out, the singer was Molly and this was her restaurant. How cool is that!\n\nShe visits their table a little later as they were just finishing the most delicious blue crab cakes they‚Äôd ever eaten. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they call it an appetizer,‚Äù he tells his wife. ‚ÄúGood, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù asks Molly. ‚ÄúYes! It sure is.‚Äù\n\nHe tells her he was going to say ‚ÄúYou must be Molly,‚Äù but that he‚Äôs already asked some questions and knows that to be the case. ‚ÄúI love this place,‚Äù Kim tells Molly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs relaxing and just what I needed.‚Äù Molly smiles and goes on to tell them how she and her husband both worked in the theatre in New York City and came to Midland about 6 years ago to open the restaurant. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still working in the theatre.‚Äù What a delightful host! ‚ÄúWe love food. We love people. We love music.‚Äù So, this was Molly‚Äôs Bistro and the main course was truly amazing. They talked about how wonderful it was to bump into a place like this. What an experience!\n\nAs they head out, they stop at the table where Molly is chatting and laughing with a few friends. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut I just wanted to tell you how much we enjoyed eating here. We‚Äôre from a long way down the road but we will be back.‚Äù Kim adds, ‚ÄúYou can bet we‚Äôll be back.‚Äù Molly smiles and reaches out to hug him. He reciprocates and they head out to hit the road.\n\nThe experience at the bistro will stick in memory for quite a while thanks to a classy lady named Molly.\n\n(prior discussion)\n",

I‚Äôm getting plenty of rest and am eating well while taking a number of medications. All in all, I am recovering and doing what is necessary to continue doing so at a pretty good pace. Life is good. Following is what happened in a nutshell.\n\n\n\nOn November 22, I was standing at the sink in my bathroom when I felt dizzy and collapsed to the floor. I‚Äôm not sure how long I was down but it seemed I went down to my knees while reaching out to the toilet to catch myself and came right back up to a standing position. I felt massive pain and pressure across my forehead and extreme tightness in my neck. Apparently, I had experienced a ruptured cerebral aneurysm and spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, defined as bleeding into the space between the brain and the middle membrane covering the brain.\n\nAfter briefly considering my options, I called Kim at work and told her to get home as soon and as safely as possible. I got dressed and ready to go and she got home pretty quick. We went to the emergency room of our hospital of choice closest to home and after talking to us for just a few minutes and performing a quick CT scan, the ER physician gave instructions quickly to several personnel around us and we were quickly rushed via ambulance to another hospital known for its expertise in the area and I underwent a non-invasive surgical procedure called endovasular coiling that blocked the blood flow through the aneurysm. My understanding is that the platinum coils were used to arrest the bleeding and stabilize my situation.\n\nA few hours later, I woke up and Kim was there in front of me smiling. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre gonna be okay baby.‚Äù She was right.\n",

In my case, he did save my life (along with the 12 wild days and nights of followup care in the ICU). I am thankful but tired - but I am alive. It‚Äôs great to be back. More soon for those who care to watch for updates after I‚Äôve had more time to rest, recover, and reflect.\n\n(prior discussion)\n",

      "content"  : "Excuse me, but I‚Äôve just earned some major gloating rights and if I don‚Äôt let it out soon, my head just might explode. I did send Kim a text message about completing the project a few hours ago, but she was just getting up in Ningbo, Japan. Damn I miss her!\n\nShe returned a ‚ÄúYAY‚Äù by text but I decided not to call her yet ‚Äì dealing with a 14 hour time difference is hard enough on my rockstar and I‚Äôll have a chance to talk to her soon, though maybe not soon enough to ward off that nasty exploding head trick. I guess that means you‚Äôre stuck with it my friend. Let the gloat begin.\n\n\n\nI‚Äôm considering buying something that will make it considerably easier to deal with fallen (and in some cases, cut down) trees around the property. Carrying cut-up logs around isn‚Äôt exactly easy on this old back and there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äôem. That same something will also come in handy for dealing with snow. But I need somewhere to keep the darn thing before I go out and buy it. What to do?\n\nSo, six days ago, I picked up one of those storage sheds in a box. You know, a huge, flat box full of metal parts and hundreds of screws and bolts, not to mention a thick instruction booklet written by someone with a wicked sense of humor and the language skills of a brick. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be easy,‚Äù I thought to myself as I laid down my money and told them I‚Äôll need some help getting it into my truck.\n\nBefore building the shed, I needed to create a level foundation to build it on and take care of making a wood floor for it. I started five days ago and am pleased to say I finished it this afternoon. I‚Äôve got a brand new 8‚Äôx10‚Ä≤ building, roof included. Though the instructions called for two people, I decided to give it a shot by myself. There‚Äôs nothing like the thrill of taking on a challenge that I‚Äôm not exactly cut out for and pulling it off. Like my buddy James Brown used to say, ‚ÄúI feel good!‚Äù\n\nOh yeah - thanks for listening‚Ä¶;~))\n\n(prior discussion)\n",

The author talks about why she ‚Äòmight have quit‚Äô Facebook and three of the listed reasons have stuck in my mind since originally reading the article:\n\n\n  \n    I wanted to get to know people in person\n    I wanted people to get to know me in person, but only if I like them\n    I had forgotten how to surf the internet for interesting content\n  \n\n\nThere‚Äôs something I find really interesting about social networking. While the various social networks do provide a way for real friends (and family) to stay in touch, I think for many, the emphasis is on how many followers they can gain. Somewhere along the line, the concept of ‚Äòfriendship‚Äô has become diluted. People think of followers as friends and that‚Äôs just not necessarily true.\n\nThe majority of the lasting friendships in my life come from knowing people in person and them knowing me in person. Face-to-face interaction makes a big difference in getting to know someone. There are a just a few close friends in my life who I‚Äôve never actually met in person (though I intend to). Having been online for many years, I think many people (including myself) are not exactly what they may appear to be on the web.\n\nOn that other point still stuck in my mind from the article, I just need to say I have not forgotten how to surf the web for interesting content, nor have I lost interest in doing so. But I‚Äôve got a feeling that many people have, or at least no longer have time for such pursuits because they spend so much time on social network sites. I‚Äôm not on Facebook and though I‚Äôm back on Twitter for now, I doubt it‚Äôll be long before I leave it again for the umpteenth time. This whole social networking thing is not my favorite thing about the web, thank you.\n",

Along the front window inside the store, there was a long bench where customers waited for their prescriptions to be filled. In the morning, the sun usually shone brightly through that front window and once or twice a month, one of the waiting customers would keel over on the bench. Now and then, a poor soul would die before the ambulance even got there. I learned how fragile life is.\n\nThe vivid memory of people periodically dying on that bench in the drugstore serves as an important reminder in my own life to make today count while I still have the chance‚Ä¶\n",

      "content"  : "Originally, we weren‚Äôt planning on going. We were always too busy to do much of anything anymore, or, at least, it seemed that way. Brushing off the daily grind to have some fun enjoying what you really like to do seems so difficult at times, but some things remind you how important it is to hold on to the good stuff. Something inside told me that we should do it - make the time and go!\n\nSo, I thought I was just going to a Clapton concert. I had never seen him and this was my chance. I started playing guitar in college and Clapton was one of my earliest inspirations. I‚Äôve always had this thing for the blues and he played it so well. We did go, excited on the way that we were gonna see the man. As it turned out, Clapton was just a part of the experience that affected me so.\n\nIt‚Äôs Saturday evening at Alpine Valley and the bill includes Eric Clapton, Jeff Healey and a guy named Stevie Ray Vaughan. I had all kinds of Clapton stuff in my vinyl collection and had recently bought a Jeff Healey CD which was pretty good. I know I had heard a song on the radio that Stevie Ray Vaughan did but I just wasn‚Äôt real familiar with him. I figure if he‚Äôs playing on the same bill as Clapton, he must be good. The band that Clapton had together for the concert was great. They did some of his classics, and some of the newer stuff and it was all great. I felt so thankful to be there.\n\nJeff Healey was damn good too. The way he played the guitar was unique, sitting with it on his lap with both hands above it. He fingered the chords like he was playing a piano or something.\n\nBut what really affected me in a big way that night was that guy named Stevie Ray. He played a bunch a stuff with Clapton‚Äôs band and I couldn‚Äôt believe how good this guy was. Then, when he played voodoo chile all on his own up there, it transformed me. Watching the closeup of his long fingers attacking the guitar on the big screen made me cry like a baby. It wasn‚Äôt the lightning speed that got to me - it was the way he was digging his fingers into every note he played. He made every note scream like no other guitarist I‚Äôve seen. Not Clapton - not B.B. King - not even Jimi himself - nobody, as great as they are, had affected me so with their blues style. Mouth open, eyes glazed, I watched his every move, wondering where he had been all my life. My thankfulness for being there was soon replaced by a truly spiritual notion that I was part of a feeling that would never be duplicated. As I watched Stevie Ray, I knew I was there for a reason.\n\nOn the following night Stevie Ray Vaughan was killed in a tragic accident. To this day, I feel so lucky that I saw him. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, if I hear his familiar sound on the radio, I have to stop and give myself to his magic. My own guitar playing (and my love for it) was greatly affected by having seen him that night and I‚Äôll always appreciate that I had the chance. Just as with other great musicians who died young, it‚Äôs so sad that we‚Äôll never see the place he was on the way to with his music. Thanks Stevie!\n\n(originally published at the original simply. personal. and at ùöìùöòùöé.\n",
