&lt;p&gt;Back when I got real sick a few months ago, I was bedridden at home for 8 days before finally deciding to go to the ER. I doubt I would have survived those days at home had it not been for my wife Kim who was always there for me. We stayed in touch with messages and everything I needed appeared in a flash. She is kinda amazing, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. One late evening, I used Siri to tell Kim ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (not an odd request in context). A short while thereafter, the doorbell rang several times. It was the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-could-this-happen&quot;&gt;how could this happen?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I gave the &lt;em&gt;hey Siri&lt;/em&gt;, it was picked up by a new HomePod, recently purchased to use as a hub for Matter accessories. At the time, I replaced 4 outlets with new ones requiring the new hub. I failed to take into account the fact that the HomePod provides only spoken confirmations. Turns out I heard the confirmation just as poorly as Siri heard my command. Oops! My bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a neighbor of ours named Ken got the help message and rightfully called the police because he was concerned that it could be a genuine request (though he thought it was most likely some kind of error). I later told him how much I appreciated that he cared enough to do that. Good neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-what-did-joe-learn&quot;&gt;and what did joe learn?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Siri turns off the wrong light, so what! When Siri sends an important message to the wrong person though, that‚Äôs a biggie. Though Kim convinced the police that everything was okay, it could have gone much differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn‚Äôt take long to figure out how it happened and what I needed to do to prevent such a thing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New rule - disable &lt;em&gt;personal requests&lt;/em&gt; on devices that provide spoken confirmations only. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
