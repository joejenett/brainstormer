Decades ago, I was one of the giggling twins standing and jumping up and down on the passenger seat next to our mother who was driving the little Nash Rambler. I think we were about 3 years old at the time and this is the earliest memory I’ve managed to retain over the years. 

There’s a number of other pleasant memories since then through the next 5 years or so but many moments in my youth thereafter were destined to become repressed memories as an adult. 

The thing about repressed memories is that they never really go away.
