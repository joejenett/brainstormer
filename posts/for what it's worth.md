So Trump say’s he’s the anti-establishment candidate. Really? Isn’t he really just an exaggeration of the old establishment trying to undo the changes that have taken place in society since that establishment was in control? Getting back the control is Trump’s real vision of “making America great again.”

In my mind, he’s the anti-diversity candidate more than anything else. Only a real racist would understand how to manipulate racist’s as well as Trump does. He’s really good at it but that’s not part of a presidential skill set.
