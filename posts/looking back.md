looking back

I can remember walking around the old neighborhood wondering what water temperature would be best for washing my hair. I also thought about whether or not I would ever have it cut again. It had grown quite long while I was in school and coming back to the neighborhood after almost four years was awkward for me to say the least. I needed to find a job quick. Living in that old house again on Royal Palm Avenue with my mother wasn't an option. I wouldn't have been able to handle that for very long and as it turned out, I didn't have to. Nor did I cut my hair.

40 years later, looking back, I realize that little has changed.
