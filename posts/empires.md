an excerpt from the lyrics of “Hurt”

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I see the web becoming a network of personal empires. In our own dominions, we say what needs to be said and share what we want to share. Here I am, glad to see so many people...so many empires.

We are connected. Each of our homes and neighborhoods give shape to a world we all live in. I need to see your empire. I want to know who you are. Even if it hurts.
