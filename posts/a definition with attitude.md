From Apple’s Dictionary.app:

**mer·ce·nar·y** | ˈmərsəˌnerē |

**adjective**  

(of a person or their behavior) primarily concerned with making money at the expense of ethics: _she's nothing but a mercenary little gold digger._

An odd example as if it was written by an angry misogynistic guy or something. I’m just saying...

hehe
