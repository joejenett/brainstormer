<p>From Apple’s Dictionary.app:
</p><blockquote>
<p><big><b>mer·ce·nar·y</b></big> <span style="color:#999;">"| ˈmərsəˌnerē |</span></p>
<p><b>adjective</b></p>
  <p><span style="color:#444;font-style:normal;">(of a person or their behavior) primarily concerned with making money at the expense of ethics:</span> <span style="color:#777;font-style:italic;">she's nothing but a mercenary little gold digger.</span></p>
</blockquote>
An odd example as if it was written by an angry misogynistic guy or something. I’m just saying...<p></p><p>hehe</p>
