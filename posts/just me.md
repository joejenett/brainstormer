**maybe it’s just me - or not** 

The first installment of *invisible thoughts.*

**two polls**

So I just finished reading an article about the downside of advertising. I agreed with much of what it said until I came to the money shot. A simple text link led to the author's other side - a site selling various professional services. He went on to say that his form of advertising was a better form than *advertising.* Though I actually agree, it’s still advertising. It’s commercial, not personal. My concept of *commercial* is probably different than that of most people.

In my life and especially on the web, I have this thing about keeping the personal and commercial stuff separate. Like anyone, I have a business side. No one can survive without taking care of business.
