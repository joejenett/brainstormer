When it comes to politics, I want information! I’ve been listening to news in the background somewhat constantly ever since a certain orange man came down the fancy escalator to announce his candidacy years ago. 

Additional noise about the topic is hard to tolerate. At least, it is for me and I’d bet it is for you too. As a result, I hesitate to write about politics at _i.webthings_ or my blogs. In fact, I filter out such noise at Mastodon and hesitate to write about it there too. 

The reality is we’re all caught in the middle a non-stop shitshow. It won’t end well for it’s host but until it does end, I’ve got much better things to do with my time than to whine about it - fuck it!

Nuff said.
