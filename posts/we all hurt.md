“When one part of America hurts, we all hurt.”

Okay, so does that mean that when 65% of Americans are hurting about the state of our government,  the other ~35% are also hurting?

I don't think so. That 35% clings to Trump overlooking his daily absurdity and assaults on the 
intelligence of the rest of the _American people_. It's understandable that the so-called base 
doesn't want to be wrong but the fact is they made a bad choice and our country is going to shit 
because of it being that way.
