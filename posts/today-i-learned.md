My good friend Anne once ended a blog post with the question, “Anything you’ve learned from life so far you’d care to pass along?” That was a long time ago but I’ve finally gathered just a few answers:

*   It’s much easier to give advice than to take it.
*   There’s no shortage of crazy in the world.
*   When someone starts with “I’m not a racist but,” they probably are.
*   Texting while driving is just as dangerous as driving drunk, which is pretty f-ing dangerous!
*   Gun lobbyists are dangerous to all of us as well.

Then again, what do I know?
