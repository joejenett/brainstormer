It was an old step van and the passenger seat wasn’t anchored. As my father drove, the seat slid forward then back then forward again. What a ride! I’m [guessing](https://ideas.joejenett.com/#shatters) I was about 10 or 11-years-old then based on the fact that Tony was with us in the van. He was a guy my father helped to immigrate from Cuba (in 1959?). We were on the way to [the bay](https://ideas.joejenett.com/#the%20bay).
