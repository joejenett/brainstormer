It used to be that crossroads were simple intersections. Continue down the road or turn on to the other. Dealing with that simple intersection was at least doable and if the wrong decision was made, getting back to the crossroad was always possible. It was never exactly like that though it seemed to be. A little hope always went a long way.  

In todayâ€™s world, though, the amount of *crazy* around us is growing faster than the number of flies surrounding a fresh pile of you-know-who's bullshit.
