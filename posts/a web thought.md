The web has changed but there remain remnants of what it once was in terms of personal sites. I track some of those remnants, curating such sites (which are still active, or when I’m lucky, new), hoping to somehow keep my original vision of the web intact. It’s a tough road to drive on but I’ve got a decent set of wheels with a few bells and whistles and more important, I enjoy the driving.
