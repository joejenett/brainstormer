I think we were about 3 years old at the time and this is the earliest memory I’ve managed to retain over the years. There’s a number of other pleasant memories since then through the next 5 years or so but many moments in my youth thereafter were destined to become repressed memories as an adult. The thing about repressed memories is that they never really go away.","parent":"posts/shatters.md","score":0.8524982905518218},{"content":"To be honest, I’m not sure if it was the Delaware Bay or the Chesapeake Bay but Tony and my father had these huge cages for catching crabs and we’d return [home](above%20the%20sub%20shop.md) with bushels of ’em.","parent":"posts/the bay.md","score":0.8446311735088248},{"content":"We lived above the sub shop.
