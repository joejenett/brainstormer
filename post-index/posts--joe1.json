It is also much simpler to implement.

Tools for thought aren't about hierarchy and order, they're about freeing your thoughts to mingle with each other. It's less about ordering your thoughts into a hierarchical empire, and more about letting them wander freely, so that they might bear fruit.\n\nThat's why I picked the name nomad hypertext.","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.8219144689169766},{"content":"Sometimes, you want multiple paragraphs to be grouped together as if they were one.

I found the idea that you could create a myriad of functionality with just one powerful feature extremely fascinating.\n\nWhat he says about links, I believe to be true about semantic search.","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.8182720036842824},{"content":"I'll end with a haiku.\n\nNomad Hypertext\nPowered by semantic search\nGives inspiration","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.8171806080511995},{"content":"I was greatly inspired by two blogposts.

The biggest pro is that it generates a static blog. There's no backend to maintain, and it's quite lightweight and loads fast, while also providing the benefit of semantic hyperlinks.
