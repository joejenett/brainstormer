{"The web has changed but there remain remnants of what it once was in terms of personal sites. I track some of those remnants, curating such sites (which are still active, or when I’m lucky, new), hoping to somehow keep my original vision of the web intact. It’s a tough road to drive on but I’ve got a decent set of wheels with a few bells and whistles and more important, I enjoy the driving.":[{"content":"The web has changed but there remain remnants of what it once was in terms of personal sites.

I think we were about 3 years old at the time and this is the earliest memory I’ve managed to retain over the years. There’s a number of other pleasant memories since then through the next 5 years or so but many moments in my youth thereafter were destined to become repressed memories as an adult. The thing about repressed memories is that they never really go away.","parent":"posts/shatters.md","score":0.8096118911483468},{"content":"Welcome to the brainstormer.","parent":"posts/welcome.md","score":0.8065218568702265},{"content":"<img src=\"https://ideas.joejenett.com/images/goodstart.png\" alt=\"\">","parent":"posts/sub.md","score":0.8052104791676786},{"content":"It was an old step van and the passenger seat wasn’t anchored.
