The biggest pro is that it generates a static blog. There's no backend to maintain, and it's quite lightweight and loads fast, while also providing the benefit of semantic hyperlinks. The con is that since the index is precomputed, you can't search for arbitrary things like you can in nomad hypertext.","parent":"posts/What is Yurt.txt","score":0.8925439136486684},{"content":"At build time, it embeds all your posts into vectors and puts them into a vector database. Then, for each paragraph in a post, it queries the vector database for the 20 most similar paragraphs from all your notes. It stores these in a precomputed index.

The first, [Hyperlink Maximalism](https://thesephist.com/posts/hyperlink/) by Linus Lee talks about generating hyperlinks automatically between documents, and comes with a [demo](https://notation.app) that made a deep impression on me.

Tools for thought aren't about hierarchy and order, they're about freeing your thoughts to mingle with each other. It's less about ordering your thoughts into a hierarchical empire, and more about letting them wander freely, so that they might bear fruit.\n\nThat's why I picked the name nomad hypertext.","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.8160283814749959},{"content":"It does this by dividing your notes up into paragraph-sized blocks and indexing them into a vector database with an AI embedding model.","parent":"posts/What is Nomad Hypertext.txt","score":0.801119751498482}]}
